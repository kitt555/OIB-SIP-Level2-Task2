            <h3 class="second-div-title">Remembering Mahanayak: The leading light of Bengali cinema on his 42nd death anniversary</h3>
            <div class="second-div-bio">
                <p>Throughout his career, <strong>Uttam Kumar</strong> remained a commercial as well as a critical success and is still considered an <strong>Indian cultural icon.</strong> With a career spanning over decades, Uttam Kumar did around <strong>200 films</strong> starting with 1948’s film <strong>Drishtidan.</strong> One of Mahanayak’s most applauded films remains <strong>Satyajit Ray’s Nayak</strong> in 1966. It is widely accepted that Satyajit Ray wrote the script for this film <strong>keeping Uttam Kumar in mind.</strong> The sense of restlessness and anxiety depicted in the movie closely resembles that of Uttam Kumar’s life, about his superstardom and how he was always worrying about it ending. Years later <strong>Satyajit Ray</strong> did confess that had Uttam Kumar rejected the script he would have discarded the entire project. After the epic success of <strong>Drishtidan</strong> in 1966, Uttam Kumar did another film with Satyajit Ray named <strong>Chiriyakhana</strong> in 1967. Mahanayak was one of the Indian artists who liked to explore his boundaries, and indeed he did.</p>
